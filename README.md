PROJECT EULER SOLUTIONS
=======================

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler's problems](https://projecteuler.net/).

Each problem is solved using Python (version 2.7+) and may include different solutions to the same problem, going from the trivial solution to the best solution I could think of at the time. All solutions but the best one will be commented out.
